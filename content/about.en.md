Richard Strauss Society Poland is the first and the only Polish society which shows interests in this composer’s works. It was founded in Wrocław in 2014 – Richard Strauss 150th anniversary. We would also like to present Strauss’ contemporaries – artists who still remain unknown to Polish audience, and discover and make popular the music of young composers and forgotten ones.

The organization consists of people having a rich experience in media, culture and science sector. What is important for us is the artistic honesty.

Richard Strauss Society’s activity is supported by its friends from Vienna, Prague, Berlin, Budapest, Rome, London, New York and Warsaw.
