## The Society in Budapest

The next project of the Richard Strauss Society is the media cooperation with the Hungarian State Opera. We asked some of the best Polish journalists to take part in the premiere of Gounod’s ‘Faust’, a performance staged by Michał Znaniecki, the first Polish stage director in this institution. The production premiered in May, 17th and was a great success.
