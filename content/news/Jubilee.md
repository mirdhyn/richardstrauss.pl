## Richard Strauss’s Jubilee

Richard Strauss was born in the 11th of June 1864. In 2014 we celebrate the 150. year of his birthday – a year full of his concerts 
and opera productions in many top music institutions. 
We encourage you to take part in such a unique anniversary of one the world’s most interesting composer.
